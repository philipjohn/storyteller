Bring storytelling to your WordPress site

== Description ==

Storytelling is wonderful. It helps us understand each other. It can empower us. It can make us laugh, cry or fall silent.

Storyteller turns WordPress unto a storytelling platform so that you can solicit stories between people and organisation, bridging communications gaps and helping to foster productive relationships where they may not otherwise exist.

== Installation ==

Just like any other WordPress plugin.
